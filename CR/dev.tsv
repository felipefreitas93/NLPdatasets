0	creative are the sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static
1	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good
1	the diaper champ is the best we found !
1	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
1	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it
1	everything , so far , has worked flawlessly
1	these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one
1	the powershot g3 is a great camera
1	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did
1	this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device
1	yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best
0	00 good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks
1	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime
0	i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products
1	but canon never fails to amaze
1	the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own )
0	as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec
1	the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire
0	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing
1	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx
0	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended
1	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product
1	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods
1	1 record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro
0	next , the big reason not to buy any norton product if there 's a problem with it , norton charges 30 to even tell them about it
0	i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired
1	have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile
1	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
1	software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )
0	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that
0	when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless
1	it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003
0	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring
0	all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera
0	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture
0	secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go
1	but for what i do use it is perfect
1	all in all it hasn 't been a bad product
0	the dynamic playlists ( now playing , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate
1	it works great
1	it will read and play all cd audio disc
0	update january 27th 2004 the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product !
0	dont rely on t mobile rebates
1	this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another
0	creative software stinks
1	the sound is incredible very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast
1	takes excellent photos
0	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device )
1	this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start up from 4 down to 2
1	this is a good deal for music and data storage
1	one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem
1	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference
1	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes )
1	also , you have to use it with itunes or they 'll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything
1	their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions
1	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket
1	mixed bag i guess but the price was right
1	upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player
0	the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life
1	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy
0	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made
1	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them
1	the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't
0	while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with alerts every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off
0	the top did not fit well into the unit ( felt defective )
1	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned
0	if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !
1	and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small )
0	while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch
0	the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged
0	the customer support is pathetic
1	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product
1	it looks sleek and modern
1	the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen
0	i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise
1	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good
1	even at the normal setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a digital
1	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance
0	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today
1	for more than a year , and it is totally reliable
0	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible
1	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder
1	this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get
0	both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best
0	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras
1	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
0	norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer
1	they take excellent macro shots as well
1	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad
1	the other controls are all very easy to use
1	saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out
1	most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy
1	built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig
1	it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs com for more on that )
0	even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do
0	but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function
0	the player itself has all sorts of problems
0	ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved
1	it 's far better than all others on the market
1	well , i have an ipod mini and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more
1	i like the auto fit feature you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal
1	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality )
0	i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone
1	it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight
0	images taken indoor were n 't so clear
0	t mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate
0	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out
1	i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it
1	the pop up blocker and anti spam are bonuses
0	2 despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax
1	if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !
1	their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific
1	these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable
1	sure , this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod
0	all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional
1	overall , i highly recommend this phone
0	downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard
1	nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop
1	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player
0	now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working i have to send it away again
0	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once
0	if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system !
1	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time
1	working for 10 hours with it on shuffle totally rocks ! !
0	it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to )
1	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips
1	the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 !
0	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with
1	setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate
0	other than that it is all the same except the new updates
0	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd
0	it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus
1	i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper
0	if you think you are saving 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth 40 less than a makita
0	the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well
1	and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3 smtp e mail account
1	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 it plays just about anything you put in the drawer
0	i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable
1	easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
1	this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router
0	it is not reliable
1	the bottom line is phone is cool one only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones
1	it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is
1	i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it !
0	you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best
0	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
0	if you have an older version of internet security installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install
1	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist
0	some dvd 's i rented would not play
1	great quality picture and features
1	it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
1	this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time
1	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad
1	the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion
1	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems
1	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use
1	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints
0	namely , it wouldnt sync
0	can 't say whether i rec 'd an updated model but it will not read dvd rw 's or vcd 's for me
1	the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
0	2 ) the body construction buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic
1	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up
1	am so glad i bought this camera
0	it also has unproven battery life
1	the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up
0	does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library
1	however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes
1	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street
0	d ) software is another great misfortune hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
1	overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s w worked well to connect
1	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
0	the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend
1	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar
1	great sound ! i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones
1	fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket
0	many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player
0	also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! ) and so does the smell of their diapers !
1	i am very pleased so far
1	purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever
1	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images
1	i also love that you can flip the device with one hand
0	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display
1	definitely a great camera
1	unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot
1	this is a great diaper pail
1	and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did !
1	i loved this product when i first got it great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood
1	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations
0	after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful
0	there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive
1	great sound good interface replaceable , powerful battery good software wake up , sleep timers multiple play modes
1	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500
0	the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone
0	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman
0	i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating
1	it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! )
1	fact is , it could n 't be easier to use
1	it holds plenty of songs
0	i am bored with the silver look
1	the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance
0	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
0	i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window
1	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred
1	for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result
1	i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option
0	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be
1	seems to work great
1	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality
1	the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive
0	this product has virtually all the same installation problems
1	overall it is a great value
1	it has it all
1	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better
1	so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? size 2
1	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me
1	it was no problem for me to use their software
0	i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the sliding wrench which comes on the router
1	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set
1	the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it
1	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways
1	i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone
1	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower priced progressive scan players as well )
1	installation was as near automatic as can be
0	es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now
0	the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc
0	they have the worst service of any of the major companies
0	my only significant complaint is sound quality
0	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case
1	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had
0	it is hot enough to be annoying
0	don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space
1	this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat
1	as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen
1	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable
1	it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course
1	if you use linux and want gr ps and or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera this is the phone for you
1	have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility
1	5 check traffic411 com for la traffic on the 405
1	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth )
0	the software sucks
1	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides
1	the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent
1	the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market
0	and supply those stupid white headphones
1	it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket
1	i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills
1	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
1	i was using the cheaper pail and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart
0	i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it
1	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive
0	so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs )
1	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well
0	this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last
1	the micro seemed like an ipod for less
1	it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems
1	but this camera is great !
1	i absolutely love it
1	overall an excellent phone
1	i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors
1	actually , the creative zen micro solves all that
1	other than that , i love this camera
1	it 's a great looking , easy to use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player
1	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it
1	i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad
0	imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex
0	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working
0	it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 for the day to day use
1	it films 10 second video , for crying out loud
0	3 mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws
1	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 0
1	for instance , i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r ( w ) and r ( w ) and it plays the dvds
1	the blue backlight is pretty cool
0	very annoying
0	i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable
1	the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute
0	f ) it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course
1	but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver
1	i recommend t mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation
1	also , the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage
1	a sony erickson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price
1	in general it is easy to use and well laid out
1	i just bought this player today and i already love it
1	i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ
1	this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection
1	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison
0	though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices
0	after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up
0	styling ergonomics the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn must be paid when dialing
1	it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !
1	you 'll love it !
0	this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope
1	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel
1	it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great
1	original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !
1	i would put the hitachi up with the best !
0	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight )
0	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all
1	the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients
1	the moveable lcd screen is great
0	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product
0	when the player was working it was great , but
1	the phone itself is pretty nice
0	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games
1	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera
1	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay 300 for this great player
0	it does take some getting used to
0	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected
0	you can see the lens barrel in the view finder
0	so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option
1	pros huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
1	neat feature for self timer allows you to record two different warnings
0	yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable
1	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it
0	sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two
1	the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie ins
1	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is
1	this is a very light phone a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology )
0	not compatible with audible com books
1	i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did
1	since then , i have not found one major problem with it
1	the picture rs are amazing
1	way less expensive than the ipod
0	the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated
0	when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month
1	despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) does more than most does it well is dependable
1	the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod
1	the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with
1	all the good reviews for the sd500 are true
0	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all
0	the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have 50 75 success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device
0	who wants to pay 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 95 ? ( i also bought the back up cd )
0	sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault
1	it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots
0	this is ridiculous
1	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person
0	the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob
1	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep
0	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing
1	i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior
1	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen
1	a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years
1	the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive
1	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it
1	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs
1	the i pod is the best thing i have ever used
0	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
1	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high speed internet connection
0	it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time
0	a little weighty ( 9 ounces no biggie ) , but otherwise fine
1	with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster
0	the pictures are a little dark sometimes
0	this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there
1	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing
1	im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
0	of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless
0	poor visibility on the keys
1	nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby
0	the price is more
1	from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3 1 4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price
1	this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems
1	so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all
1	with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long
0	it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc
0	long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot
0	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
1	it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily
0	this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people
0	we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
0	it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be
0	1 no direct firewire to the camera
1	and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills
1	they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger
1	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid
1	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
0	loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well
1	i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use
1	if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro
0	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best
0	this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online
0	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to
1	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me
1	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures
1	the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player
1	my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic
1	when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental
0	after two weeks the picture kept freezing
0	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose
1	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made
0	also , the instruction manual is very bad
0	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage
1	i highly recommend this !
0	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing
1	you can also slow a song down speed it up , which is cool too
1	supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone
0	his is what i get for my 200 on this mp3 player ?
0	another problem is that the latest 2 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads charging 2
0	mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars )
0	the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best
1	i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1 2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine )
0	only con i can think of is no camera
1	for the price i don 't think you can beat it
1	my first impression was positive
1	in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep
1	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted
1	my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not whine during video , and my pictures are razor sharp
1	the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer
1	it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife )
0	i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience
1	i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made
1	they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great
0	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 )
1	i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple
1	i didn 't have any major problems installing this software
0	eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files
1	picture quality 's great for still and video with sound
0	our norton internet av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok
1	the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is two thumbs up !
0	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job
0	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet
1	so far the software for the pc works easily
1	operating its many features is easy and often obvious i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store
1	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all
1	the service from t mobile is very good too
0	we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless
1	i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great
0	i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played
0	the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq
1	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed
1	the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration )
1	took hundreds of pictures and they were great
1	update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it !
0	nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software
0	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since
1	i highly recommend a nokia 6610
0	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating )
1	you have the option to have the flash automatic or off
0	the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !
0	4 ) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras
0	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones !
1	i love this pail !
0	the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem
0	i mean , they 're short !
1	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want
0	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes
1	i am very pleased with my purchase
1	all in all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype
1	extremely convenient
0	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust
0	the included headphones suck , so get your own
1	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly
1	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8 track records
1	the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature
1	the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was 135 !
1	the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company
0	i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location
1	3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months
0	the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies
0	it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman
0	i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked !
1	the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp
1	if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w the diaper genie
1	but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it 's a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying
1	i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue
1	great features
0	also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and or the process of updating internet security
1	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet
0	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile
1	this phone has many other features , ir , just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial
1	another point of note the battery life is incredible !
0	then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not
1	it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up
1	no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find !
1	drops and strong signals even from the backyard
0	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it
1	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset
1	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price
0	3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files
0	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said
1	another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable
1	take quick pictures with excelent resolution
1	ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well
1	the panorama setting is unbelievable !
1	fm radio built in ( howard stern )
1	you can do so much more with the pc suite , i e free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps games
1	while i had the phone , the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece
0	you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once
0	what a junk
1	the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use
1	so far i have used all of the above mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand
1	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly
1	it is a nice router in all ways but one
0	the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17
1	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support
0	stay away from this product !
0	yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone
1	it also holds a lot more diapers
0	the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software
0	apex does n 't answer the phone
0	nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now
1	camera is a paper weight
1	putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download
0	it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full
0	will never purchase apex again
0	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift
1	this really is a great little phone its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
1	they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic 's and sennheisers
1	it 's such a great camera ! i think it really was worth the investment )
1	bright , visible screen
0	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work
0	to my amazement , even that process was error prone
0	the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed
1	creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie
1	i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs
0	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as sexy looking
1	ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned
1	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want
0	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up
1	sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder
0	again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage
1	2 ) storage capacity
1	this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi tech casing
0	because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery
0	i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table
1	it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review
1	in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus
0	its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips )
0	so , right out of the box i had issue
1	it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon )
1	1 the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer
1	great design very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus
1	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it
0	the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer
1	overall this is a slightly better than average phone
0	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed !
0	on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside
0	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button
0	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection
0	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots
1	i liked this one enough to buy another
1	yes , the 1 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem
0	after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings
1	and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
0	symantec should give us all a refund and apology !
0	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner
0	this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas
1	i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal
1	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results
1	uploading music is quick and easy
1	the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast !
1	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad
1	really easy to use
1	creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature
0	iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed
0	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets
1	awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself
0	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
0	third , the poor design continues with the case
0	the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera
1	it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills
1	especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around
1	loved the slim design
0	unfortunately i was wrong
1	also included in the games section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs
0	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice
1	but , for the money it is a good machine
1	i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler
0	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance
0	of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident
0	the dvd player just would 't recognize them
0	first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the 300 myself
1	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured
1	it gives you the most bang for your buck , period
0	the touchpad is virtually unusable sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want
0	in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders
1	in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ
0	3 the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture
1	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone
1	the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary
1	it all sounds great too
0	so , don 't buy this or upgrade
1	for the most part this is a good dvd player
1	travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
1	i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality
1	the included software removes any red eye easily
1	you can use it as a storage hard drive
0	whatever on to the negatives touchy about charging you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side
1	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise )
1	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen
1	sound quality ? phenomenal
0	however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table )
0	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips
0	the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately
1	we use the cheap 1 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around
1	the storage capacity is great
1	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes
1	i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers
0	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control
1	likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too
0	i 've also had the nomad zen lock up several times
1	it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house
1	for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable safer unit
1	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so
0	it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung
1	( it sure does look nice , though ! ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge !
1	solid , high quality construction
1	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone
1	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my 12 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray !
0	i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel
1	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures
1	i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it
0	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared
1	i have had no problem what so ever with this product
1	and also , it 's priced very afford ably
1	1 ) price gb of storage
0	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it
0	for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it
1	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player
1	exposure compensation in 1 3 stop increments ( i leave it set on 1 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste )
1	the good 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution
1	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents
1	using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod
1	with one of the most intuitive user interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above one of the few phones from t mobile that can claim such a distinction
1	overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it
0	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600
1	firewire usb2 0 for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync
1	i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola 's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine
1	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback
0	minor complaints 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable
1	the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also
0	i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode )
0	anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants
1	this model appears to be especially good
1	this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job
1	amazon is awesome !
0	for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that
1	i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions
1	and with usb 2 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy
1	this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite
1	best electronic i 've bought since i was born
0	when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !
1	for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together
1	pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too
0	1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick !
0	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me
0	i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail
1	3 it never smelled at all
1	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate
0	customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them
1	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
1	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly
1	4 looks great
1	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me
1	pros 1 speed 2 signal strength 3 advanced configuration options
1	as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !
1	i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use
0	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
0	purchased the ad 2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it
1	i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on
1	overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity
0	the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back )
1	the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect
1	however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off
1	they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered
1	especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications )
1	an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook
1	and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own
1	well backlit keypad
1	it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch
1	holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers !
1	the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera
1	the file ripping transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use
1	this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great
1	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down
1	yes , i recommend it over the competition
1	very sturdy and strong
0	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem
1	and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space
1	but it you won 't regret it
1	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother
1	this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone
1	with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones
0	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for
0	i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !
0	software music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut
1	the soft start is nice
1	wow was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke
1	the bass treble the sound detail is aw some
1	this phone is highly recommended otherwise
0	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale
1	if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer
1	the included earphones are pretty good my advice ?
0	if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers
0	the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned
1	it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it
1	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization
0	however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosn 't work at all in the car , for example
1	it sure does !
1	even with that , i highly recommend this router outstanding performer
1	i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the mixed mode feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router
0	i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage
0	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots
1	also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers
1	smooth plunging ! ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant
0	luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger
1	t mobile is trying very hard , and again they do have pretty good csr 's
1	3 play java games on it
1	this is an excellent router for the money
1	first , it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper
0	only 1 problem , no accessories yet
1	also , it was only 39 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player
1	so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby !
0	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have
1	the m12v has been great
1	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
0	a ) feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
1	ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one
1	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class
1	excellent sound i mean the player has juice
0	it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow
0	the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful
1	the quality is superb
1	this makes for a great phone
1	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !
1	the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch
0	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating
0	protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window
0	i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required permissions and lacked proper administrator status
1	creative did an awesome job with the design
0	my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful
1	all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player )
0	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds
0	i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective
0	i originally gave this camera 5 stars when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho not compatible with xp
0	my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above
1	if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen
0	i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one
1	the photo quality is amazing
1	7 picture quality is excellent
1	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t mobile and aim is great
1	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible
0	the vibrate setting is loud !
0	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest
0	in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge
0	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software
1	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use
1	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved
1	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
1	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied
1	looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors
1	as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough
0	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive
0	on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem
0	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots
0	i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast !
0	they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to handle and ship a cd ? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails
